# Maple-iOS

A music player that plays files you keep locally on your phone. Comes with a robust social functionality that allows you to see what your friends are listening to.

## How to download?
Go to https://testflight.apple.com/join/YXZVrhnC and join the TestFlight to beta test before the final release! 
> App Store version coming soon!

## What is it?
This is an iOS port of the local music player by [Cattn](https://github.com/cattn) made for the web. Due to WebKit and Safari limitations the player doesn't work on iOS, and thus I created a native solution for iOS. Check out the project at https://maple.music to learn more about both the original project and the iOS port.

### Additional information
If you want more information on how Maple itself works, or how to use the API, check out the original repository https://github.com/cattn/maple for both the frontend and backend for Maple.
